# [Doc] The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being
# put into the costmap. Here, we have it set at 2.0 meters, which means that the robot will only update its map with
# information about obstacles that are within 2.0 meters of the base. The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the
# range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading. Setting it to 3.0 meters as we have above means
# that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 3.0 meters away given a sensor reading.
obstacle_range: 11.0
raytrace_range: 12.0

# [Doc] Specifying the footprint (2D projection in ground), the center of the robot is assumed to be at (0.0, 0.0) and
# both clockwise and counterclockwise specifications are supported.
footprint: [[-0.475, -0.355], [-0.475, 0.355], [0.201, 0.355], [0.201, -0.355]]

# [Doc] The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred.
# For example, setting the inflation radius at 0.5 meters means that the robot will treat all paths that stay
# 0.5 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost
inflation_radius: 1.0   # [m] controls how far away the zero cost point is from the obstacle

cost_scaling_factor: 10.0 # slope of the cost decay curve with respect to distance from the object. Lower makes robot stay further from obstacles

# [Doc] The "observation_sources" parameter defines a list of sensors that are going to be passing information to the costmap separated by spaces
observation_sources: scan
scan: {sensor_frame: base_scan, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
